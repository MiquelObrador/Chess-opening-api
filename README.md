# Chess-opening-api

This project has been carried out jointly with Alejandro Ibañez Peña (AlejandroIbanyez in github) and Leandro Perez Orero

This little program wrote in python uses two databases, one from https://lichess.org/ using their public api and another one from https://www.365chess.com/ using web scraping 

To execute it you will need the following libraries installed for python3:

-  chess
-  requests
- json
-  bs4
-  lxml
-  re
